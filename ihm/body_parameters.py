"""One declared schema for the parameters that describe *which body* is being run.

Before this file the answer to "how tall is the body, how heavy, and what sex"
was spread over three places that disagree with each other, and one of the three
was a literal repeated in fifty-eight scripts.  Nothing here invents a new knob:
every entry names the call site that already consumes it, or says plainly that
nothing does.

Three statuses, and the difference between them is the whole point of the file:

``surfaced``
    Already a runtime knob before this schema existed.  The schema only gives it
    a name, a unit, a range and a provenance.  ``mass_kg`` is the case.
``implemented``
    Made into a knob by this work.  ``stature_m`` is the case; it is realised by
    ``ihm.native.model_scaling`` and materialised by
    ``scripts/materialize_stature_variant.py``.
``declared``
    Written down, with a domain, and **not** reaching the running body.  ``sex``
    is the case, and its domain has exactly one member because the simulated
    body has zero sex-specific anatomical entities.  A declared parameter is a
    statement of scope, never a capability.

The two bodies.  This programme runs an anatomical body (BodyParts3D + BioGears,
described by ``ihm/assembly/profile.py``) and a mechanical body (the OpenSim
Rajagopal subject driven by ``ihm.native.mechanical_stream``).  They are
different objects with different masses and different statures, and the schema
holds both rather than picking one and hiding the other.  ``docs/DISCONNECTS.md``
item 1 is the same seam seen from the geometry side.

#: Survey-weighted regression of log weight on log standing height, NHANES
#: 2017-2018 BMX_J + DEMO_J, 4,822 adults aged 20-79, weighted by WTMEC2YR.
#: Measured by ``scripts/measure_stature_allometry.py``; the full entry with its
#: caveats lives in ``ihm.body_scaling.ALLOMETRY``.
#:
#: THIS IS NOT 3.  Geometric similarity says mass follows stature cubed, and the
#: data rejects isometry at z = -11.6.  At stature 2.03 m the cubed answer is
#: 111.9 kg and the measured answer is 99.2 kg -- 12.8% apart, and the cubed one
#: is wrong in the direction that makes a tall body too heavy to move.
#:
#: Applied, as of this commit, as the DEFAULT for ``mass_kg`` when a caller asks
#: for a stature and does not name a mass.  Before that, ``mass_kg`` defaulted to
#: the literal above no matter what stature was requested, so asking for a 2.03 m
#: body got a 2.03 m skeleton that still weighed 77.6 kg -- the stature scaling
#: was divided straight back out of the mass, and the body's density rose by 39%
#: without anything saying so.  ``mass_kg`` remains an independent knob: an
#: explicit request still wins, which is what lets a caller build a heavy short
#: body or a light tall one on purpose.
MASS_STATURE_EXPONENT = 2.034

#: The same regression fitted within sex: 2.372 for men, 1.721 for women.  The
#: pooled slope lies BETWEEN them, so it is not an artefact of mixing two groups
#: with different means, and using the within-sex slope is the more faithful
#: answer to "if I ask for a taller woman, what should she weigh".
MASS_STATURE_EXPONENT_BY_SEX = {'male': 2.372, 'female': 1.721}

#: Where the sex-stratified proportions come from.  Written by
#: ``scripts/index_anthropometry.py``; survey-weighted over 4,883 NHANES
#: 2017-2018 adults aged 20-79, with the weighting checked against the published
#: CDC/NCHS means (175.4 against 175.3 cm for men, 161.3 against 161.3 for
#: women).  ``assert_measured_defaults`` recomputes every ratio below from it.

#: Female/male ratios.  Each is a ratio of survey-weighted means, so it says how
#: this SUBJECT would be re-proportioned, not that a population mean replaces

#: large absolute difference can be a small difference in shape and the ratios
#: are where that shows.

}

#: Bodies scaled by ``leg_length_ratio``.  Isotropic per segment, and that is a
#: decision with a reason: ``walker_knee_r`` takes its three translation
#: functions in a frame rotated by (-1.64, 1.45, 1.57) rad inside ``femur_r``,
#: so a LONG-AXIS-ONLY femur scale has no componentwise meaning there and
#: ``ihm.native.anisotropic_scaling`` refuses it.  A uniform per-segment factor
#: is exact regardless of frame orientation.  It shortens the leg and slims it
#: together, which is a modelling choice, not a measurement.
