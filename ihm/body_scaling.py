"""What every quantity in the body does when the body changes size.

``ihm/native/model_scaling.py`` scales the 22-segment mechanical scaffold.  This
file scales **the body** -- the 4,000 anatomical entities, the 146 nerve routes
and their per-fibre-class conduction delays, the 1,326 skin patches, and the
muscle and tissue properties -- and it exists mostly to make one class of error
impossible.

The error is **an exponent chosen for convenience**.  Areas go as ``s**2`` and
volumes as ``s**3`` and everybody knows that; the ones that are actually got
wrong are the mixed quantities, where the temptation is to type a number that
looks about right.  Is a ligament's linear stiffness ``s``?  ``s**2``?  Invariant?
A conduction delay?  A moment arm?  A receptor density?  Typing any of those is
guessing, and a guess that happens to be right is indistinguishable from a guess
that happens to be wrong.

So **no exponent in this file is typed**.  Every one is *computed* from a
dimensional formula over a small set of primitives, and the only place a number
is written by hand is the primitive table -- where each entry is either 1 (a
length, because the scale is a linear map) or 0 (a material or chemical property,
because a taller person is made of the same stuff).  ``exponent('ligament_
stiffness')`` returns 1 because ``E*A/L`` expands to ``0 + 2 - 1``, not because
anyone decided it should.

The primitives are the whole argument, and they are stated as claims that can be
contradicted rather than as facts:

**geometric (exponent 1).**  ``length``.  One isotropic linear factor, the same
assumption ``stature_m`` already declares for the mechanical body and for exactly
the same reason: it is what makes every musculotendon path length scale by
``s`` at every pose.  It is a modelling assumption, and ``ALLOMETRY`` below is
the list of places where it is known to be false, each with the size of the error
it makes.

**material and chemical (exponent 0).**  Density, elastic modulus, muscle
specific tension, nerve conduction velocity, blood viscosity, regulated arterial
pressure.  These are properties of the tissue and not of the specimen.  The
load-bearing one is ``conduction_velocity``: axon diameter and internodal
myelin length are cellular dimensions and do not know how tall their owner is,
so a taller person's nerves are longer at the same velocity and **every
conduction delay in the body lengthens in proportion to stature**.  That is the
one physiological consequence of size that this repository can already measure
end to end, because ``docs/MILESTONES.md`` records that lumping conduction
delays costs as much as deleting an entire fibre group.

**counting (exponent 0).**  ``count``.  The number of discrete structures is a
property of the anatomy, not of its size: a taller person has the same 31 spinal
nerve pairs, the same 206 bones and -- see ``scripts/scale_skin_patches.py`` --
the same 1,326 innervated skin patches.  The consequence is that every *density*
per unit area or volume is NOT invariant, and comes out of the algebra with a
negative exponent rather than being overlooked.
