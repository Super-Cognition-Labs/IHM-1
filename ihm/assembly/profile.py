# Body mass is measured on this specimen's own geometry, not inherited. The
# BioGears StandardMale 77.1107029 kg constant cannot be reconciled with the
# acquired envelope: the composed fill weighs 31.7461 kg over the 0.032117 m3
# void, a mean 988.4 kg/m3, and reaching 77.1107029 kg would need the void to
# weigh 1185.8 kg/m3 -- denser than every soft tissue in ICRU-44 -- which by the
# Siri relation is a negative fat fraction, i.e. not a body. The two free
# choices in that ledger move the answer by 0.024 kg (8 mm vs 10 mm partition)
# and 0.534 kg (residual density swept over the whole [1000, 1060] band). Only
# the height in the inherited profile ever came from the atlas.
