"""Verify the colour-palette endpoint reads what the build wrote and fails closed on everything else.

  .venv/bin/python scripts/verify_tissue_colour_palettes.py

The builder's own --self-test checks the palettes. This checks the reader: that ihm.app.experiments
.read_palette serves the index and each palette, and that it refuses a tampered artifact, a changed
input, a missing input, a build whose self-test did not pass, and an unknown palette id.

Every tamper is done inside a tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() copy of the two directories the reader
touches. Nothing is ever written under the repository root: a fixture that writes at a
caller-supplied root must never be handed the real tree.
