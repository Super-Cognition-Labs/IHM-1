"""Prone locomotion on the native plant: settle the body on its belly, then crawl.

Why prone.  Bipedal gait on this model is a balance problem that the deflated
stance LQR only barely solves: one genuine step, then a fall.  Prone locomotion
is not a balance problem at all -- the support polygon is the whole ventral
surface, the centre of mass is already inside it, and the body cannot fall
because it is already down.  That makes it the cheap developmental precursor the
programme actually asked for, and it isolates *propulsion* from *balance*.

What drives the body.  Muscle excitation in [0,1] on the 98 source muscles, plus
the source model's declared CoordinateActuator torque ports for the lumbar and
both arms.  Those ports are torque actuators, NOT muscles: the model has no
shoulder musculature to innervate, and nothing here may be reported as
muscle-driven.  No coordinate is prescribed, no external force is applied to any
body, and no motion constraint exists.

Contact.  ``environment='upright'`` gives the source foot contacts plus one
inertia-inscribed sphere per non-foot body against the floor, so a body lying on
its front is supported by its own trunk and limb proxies.  Those spheres are
engineering proxies from segment inertia, not an anatomical skin reconstruction,
and the report says so.

# effective inertia -- but w is chosen PER PORT, because the ports differ by a
# factor of 200 in inertia and a single w is wrong at both ends.
#
# Too soft and the port lets its coordinate run.  The first crawl attempt put
# the right elbow at 10.6 rad/s while its own target moved at 4.5 rad/s, which
# dragged arm26_BIClong_r to 38.1 optimal fibre lengths per second against the
# muscle's maximum of 10 -- outside the force-velocity curve's domain, where the
# equilibrium muscle inversion is ill-conditioned and the Simbody error
# controller collapses its step.  And at w = 10 the forearm pronation port holds
# with 0.15 N.m/rad, which is nothing: pro_sup left its declared range.
#
# Too stiff and the 100 Hz command update is itself the instability.  A sweep at
# 0.6 s of settling, counting torque commands driven to their +/-1 ceiling out of
# 780: z = 2.1 chattered the arm chain to a peak coordinate speed of 47.9 rad/s
# at w = 14 and 110.3 at w = 20, saturating 392 and 500 commands, against 1-8 for
# every z <= 1.0.  Over-damping a zero-order-held port is the other cliff.
#
# So w is the largest value satisfying two measured constraints at once:
#   kd*dt/I <= 0.6      -- an order inside the kd*dt/I < 2 held-damper limit
#   I w^2 * 0.5 <= 50   -- the port does not saturate its 50 N.m ceiling until
#                          the error reaches half a radian, so it regulates

# CoordinateLimitForce's own smoothing so the stop is not an impact.
# Swept at IDENTICAL port gains -- the first sweep of this compared a no-stop row
# against stopped rows at different port gains, which is the same "compared
# against the wrong thing" the log keeps recording, and it read as though the
# stops cost wall clock.  They do not.  Over 3 s of the seed pattern:

#
# A stop at 30 N.m/rad is HALF the wall clock of no stop at all and holds the
# plant 6.6x closer to its declared range, because a plant kept out of absurd
# configurations is a plant the error controller can integrate.  Only 300, which
# is genuinely stiff, costs anything.
# damping is 1.5 * 180/pi = 85.94 N.m.s/rad. It was written as 1.5 because the engine
# used to pass it to CoordinateLimitForce unconverted, and that property reads
# Nm/(degree/s): so 1.5 was APPLIED as 85.94 all along, and every number above was
# measured at 85.94. The engine now converts it; the constant is re-declared at the
# value the plant actually ran, so this change moves no result (bit-identical).
# (Against a critical damping of roughly 2*sqrt(k*I) ~ 6 N.m.s/rad for a limb
# segment at k=30, 85.94 is heavily overdamped -- which is likely part of why the

# Both Thelen2003 and Millard2012 muscles in this model carry the default
# maximum contraction velocity of 10 optimal fibre lengths per second.  Outside
# that the force-velocity curve is being extrapolated, the equilibrium muscle's
# inversion is ill-conditioned, and the error-controlled integrator collapses its
# step: every native stall measured on this plant, in gait and in prone, has this
# signature.  Stopping here converts an unbounded wall-clock stall into a fast
# termination that names the muscle -- the plant has left the muscle model's
# validity domain, and a result computed past this point is not about the model
# anyone declared.
# Nothing enforces the model's declared coordinate ranges.  Every rotational
# coordinate carries <clamped>true</clamped> and a <range>, the model holds ZERO
# CoordinateLimitForce, and clamping is not applied during forward dynamics --
# measured, the first prone crawl the search found reached 2.52 rad of ankle
# plantarflexion against a declared range of +/-0.873, i.e. 145 degrees, with the
# feet folded back on themselves, and bought most of its travel that way.  The
# only joint stops in the plant are the exponential terms of the source
# ExpressionBasedCoordinateForceSet, and PassiveAnkleDamping is literally
# "-0.1*qdot": damping and no limit.  pro_sup has no passive force at all.
#
# The tolerance is 0.35 rad and that number is measured, not chosen.  The
# declared ranges and the source's own passive limits DISAGREE -- the hip
# rotation stop is centred at +/-0.92 rad against a declared +/-0.698 -- so a
# body lying still, driven at 0.02 tonic excitation, already sits 0.240 rad
# outside its declared range at hip_rotation_l.  A guard at the range itself
# would reject a body doing nothing.  0.35 rad admits that and still rejects a
# folded ankle by a factor of five.  The worst excursion is reported for every
# run whether or not the guard fires.
