# the body's tissue as mechanics, and where it stops being possible

645 of the bound body's 4,000 entities are tissue structures — ligaments,
capsules, menisci, discs, cartilage, bursae, fascia, retinacula, adipose — every
one of them with real mesh geometry, and the plant carried force elements for
**none** of them. They existed as geometry and not as mechanics.

**117 of them now carry force.** What that buys, measured on three different
drops rather than one: the derived set as a whole makes the plant **worse**, and
the 66 elements that survive a kinematic check make it **no worse and sometimes
much better, but not reliably so**. Added to the joint stops they improve the
worst excursion past the model's declared ranges on every drop tested, by 4–24%.
They do **not** replace those stops, and the first version of this file said they
did on the strength of one trajectory — the withdrawal is below and is the point.

This file records that, and — the part that matters most — **the specific reason
each remaining class cannot be closed on this plant**, because they are blocked
for three different reasons and only one of the three is a missing solver.

Everything here is from `scripts/build_tissue_force_elements.py`,
`scripts/measure_tissue_mechanics.py`, `scripts/measure_ligament_moments.py`,
`scripts/measure_articular_substrate.py` and
`scripts/measure_muscle_path_constraint.py`, over the `engineering_stance_v1`
pose at 77.6122029 kg.

## Where the 645 classified structures went

Classified by name from the atlas' own labels, with the same first-match order
`scripts/audit_joint_substrate.py` uses so both lanes bucket a name the same way.
*Two-segment* means the structure's own surface votes for two different scaffold
rigid bodies; *one-segment* means the two bones it joins are the **same** rigid
body here, so no relative motion exists for it to resist.

| class | entities | two-segment | one-segment | force elements written |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ligament | 300 | 105 | 195 | **105** |
| bursa / synovium | 80 | 12 | 68 | 0 |
| meniscus / disc | 69 | 10 | 59 | 0 |
| cartilage | 51 | 2 | 49 | 0 |
| tendon (mostly sheaths) | 44 | 36 | 8 | 0 |
| fascia / aponeurosis | 44 | 25 | 19 | 0 |
| joint capsule | 36 | 12 | 24 | **12** |
| retinaculum | 18 | 10 | 8 | 0 |
| adipose | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| skin | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| **total** | **645** | **215** | **430** | **117** |

**117 force elements where there were zero.** The plant now carries
`Blankevoort1991Ligament` — tension only, zero below slack, a quadratic toe to
6% strain and linear above, damped only while stretched and lengthening.

The 430 one-segment structures are not a failure of the derivation. **They are
the scaffold reporting its own resolution.** 59 of the 195 one-segment ligaments
are in `torso`, because the scaffold has one torso body and the whole spine and
rib cage are inside it; 29 per side are in `hand`, which is one rigid body
carrying 27 bones. A sacrotuberous ligament runs from sacrum to ischium and both
are `pelvis` here — so it correctly comes out one-segment, and that is a gate,
not a gap.

---

## Ligaments: how an attachment was derived, and what proves it

The recorded blocker was structural. `data/derived/anatomy-segment-binding/`
assigns each whole entity to exactly **one** segment by nearest-bone-group vertex
vote, and a ligament spans two, so the binding artifact cannot supply a
two-ended attachment. It cannot, **but the vote it is built from can**: the same
per-vertex nearest-bone-group distances that pick the winner also partition the
surface between two segments.

1. Every vertex takes the segment whose anatomical bone group is nearest. The
   two segments with the most votes are the two ends.
2. Each end's attachment is the centroid of the quarter of that end's vertices
   **furthest from the other end's centroid** — the tip, not the middle. Taking
   the centroid of each half gives an ACL 20.9 mm long against a published 32;
   the tip quantile gives 33.4.
3. Points are carried into the two segments' own frames through the binding's
   own recorded similarity and reference pose. **No new registration is fitted**,
   so this inherits the binding's 24.7 mm RMS residual and adds nothing.
4. Slack length is the separation at that reference pose, so every element is
   exactly slack in the pose its geometry was registered in.
5. Linear stiffness is `E·A`, with `E` the body's own declared ligament
   along-fibre modulus — 332.2 MPa, Quapp and Weiss 1998, human MCL — and `A`
   the structure's own tissue volume over its own derived length.

### The volume rule matters more here than where it came from

An **open** surface's signed integral is not a volume; it is the volume of what
the sheet wraps. `ihm/assembly/tissue_materials.py` owns that argument already
(84 open connective sheets were carrying 29.6 L of the muscle they wrap). Here
it decides a stiffness, because a cross-section is a volume divided by a length:
the hip capsule is an open sleeve whose signed integral is the femoral head and
neck inside it, and taking that as capsule tissue gave a **2,781 mm² cross-
section and a 924 kN ligament**. Routed through `material_volume` it gives
101 mm² and 33.6 kN.

### Gates — against cases whose answer is known

**Named pairs, 30/30.** A ligament everybody can name has two bones everybody
knows, and all of these came out right without the derivation ever seeing a name:

| structure | derived | | structure | derived |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| anterior cruciate | femur + tibia | | iliofemoral (descending) | pelvis + femur |
| posterior cruciate | femur + tibia | | pubofemoral | pelvis + femur |
| tibial collateral (both parts) | femur + tibia | | ischiofemoral | pelvis + femur |
| fibular collateral | femur + tibia | | anterior/posterior talofibular | tibia + talus |
| annular ligament of radius | radius + ulna | | calcaneofibular | tibia + calcn |

And the **negative controls**, which are the half that could have gone wrong
silently: sacrotuberous, sacrospinous and inguinal must come out **one** segment,
because both their bones are inside `pelvis`. They do. A two-segment answer there
would have been the derivation inventing a joint.

**A structure inside one bone.** Six molar and premolar teeth, run through the
same vote, return a second-segment share of **exactly 0.0**.

**Published lengths**, reported as ratios rather than asserted as agreement:

| ligament | derived | published | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| anterior cruciate | 33.4 mm | 32 | 1.04 |
| posterior cruciate | 37.5 mm | 38 | 0.99 |
| fibular collateral | 52.9 mm | 60 | 0.88 |
| calcaneofibular | 19.1 mm | 25 | 0.76 |
| superficial tibial collateral | 70.8 mm | 95 | 0.75 |
| anterior talofibular | 14.1 mm | 20 | 0.70 |

Systematically short, by about 20% at the median: the tip quantile pulls in from
the true insertion. **Published Blankevoort stiffnesses**: ACL 10.1 kN against
5 kN (2.03×), PCL 11.6 kN against 9 kN (1.29×), LCL 0.87 kN against 2 kN (0.44×).
Within a factor of two either way, and *reported*, not tuned to.

**Cross-implementation length.** The engine's `Blankevoort1991Ligament` path
length against the same length computed from the same coordinates through the
model XML's own joint definitions: **max 3.3e-16 m over 117 elements**. Two
independent implementations of the same geometry.

**Reference-pose slack.** Maximum error **exactly 0.0 m** — every element is
slack in the pose its geometry was registered in.

## What they do to the plant, and what they cost

25 advances of 10 ms from the stance pose, same mass, same excitation, only the
force set differing. `admissible` is the 66-element subset the filter two
sections below selects.

| arm | elements | weight at t=0 | momentum residual | s/advance median |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `bare` | 0 | **761.3757 N** | 4.9e-14 | 0.073 |
| `stops` — what the plant does today | 0 | **761.3757 N** | 4.9e-14 | 0.064 |
| `ligaments` | 105 | **761.3757 N** | 6.4e-13 | 0.215 |
| `ligaments_capsules` | 117 | **761.3757 N** | 3.2e-12 | 0.303 |
| `stops_ligaments` | 105 | **761.3757 N** | 6.4e-13 | 0.162 |
| `admissible` | 66 | **761.3757 N** | 1.1e-12 | 0.134 |
| `stops_admissible` | 66 | **761.3757 N** | 1.1e-12 | 0.106 |

**Standing weight is 761.3757 N in every arm, to the last digit** — 77.6122029 ×
9.81. That is the gate that says the new elements did not invent or lose external
force, and they are internal forces so they were never allowed to.

The momentum residual rises from 4.9e-14 to between 6.4e-13 and 3.2e-12. That is
not drift: the ligament arm carries **12 kN** of internal tension at t=0 and the
capsule arm **27 kN**, so the residual sits at about 1e-16 of the forces being
summed — the same relative floor the bare arm sits at. An absolute threshold here
would be comparing against the wrong thing.

**Cost is 1.8× the bare plant for the admissible set and 2.9–4.1× for the full
one, on the median.** The machine was shared and loaded while these ran, so the
worst-advance column is not reported as a tissue cost: the bare arm's own worst
advance was 1.04 s against a 0.073 s median in the same run.

---

## The gate the brief set — and the claim it took three drops to get right

> *with ligaments carrying load, the joint stops should become less necessary —
> measure the range excursion with ligaments and without, on the same trajectory*

2.0 s prone drop, nothing driving but a PD hold on the declared torque ports.
Worst excursion past the model's **own declared** coordinate ranges. Three
different initial conditions, because a rollout is deterministic and repeating it
proves nothing, but running the same arms from different drops is what says an
ordering is a property of the force set rather than of one drop.

| arm | elements | `prone` | `prone_high` | `prone_rolled` | mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `bare` | 0 | 17.43° | 30.69° | 30.27° | 26.13° |
| `stops` at 30 N·m/rad — today's plant | 0 | 5.30° | 6.62° | 5.96° | **5.96°** |
| `ligaments` | 105 | 32.78° | 35.33° | 32.88° | 33.66° |
| `ligaments_capsules` | 117 | 34.22° | — | — | — |
| `stops_ligaments` | 105 | 10.63° | — | — | — |
| `admissible` | 66 | 6.08° | 30.47° | 18.50° | 18.35° |
| `stops_admissible` | 66 | **4.05°** | **6.39°** | **5.35°** | **5.27°** |

Three results, and the middle one is a withdrawal.

**1. The derived set as a whole makes the plant worse, on every drop.** 105
ligaments take 17.4° → 32.8°, 30.7° → 35.3°, 30.3° → 32.9°. Adding them to the
stops takes 5.3° → 10.6°. Consistent in sign three times out of three.

**2. The kinematically admissible 66 do NOT replace the joint stops.** On the
`prone` drop they hold 6.08° with no stops at all, against the stops' 5.30° and a
bare plant's 17.43°, and *this file's first version reported that as ligaments
replacing the stated engineering constant.* It does not survive a second drop:
on `prone_high` the same 66 give **30.47° against a bare plant's 30.69°** — no
restraint at all — and on `prone_rolled` 18.50° against 30.27°, a real but partial
one. **The 6.08° was a lucky draw**, which is the failure mode
`docs/LOG.md` in IBM-1 records over and over; one trajectory is one trajectory
even when nothing in it is random.

What survives is weaker and true: **the admissible set is never worse than the
bare plant on any drop**, where the unfiltered set is always worse. The filter
buys safety, not restraint.

**3. Added to the stops, the admissible set helps on every drop.** 5.30 → 4.05,
6.62 → 6.39, 5.96 → 5.35. Between 4% and 24%, mean 5.96° → 5.27°, and the sign is
the same three times out of three. That is the defensible positive: the body's
own tissue, with attachments from its own surfaces and stiffness from its own
declared modulus, takes a little of the load off a stated engineering constant.
It does not take it over.

And at the end of the `prone` admissible run **no element is past ultimate
strain**: max strain 0.136, 20 of 66 loaded, 781 N of total tension.

### Why the other 51 make it worse

A line element under tension `F` makes a generalized force `−F·dl/dq`. Summing
that over the derived set gives the passive moment the ligaments make about each
coordinate, as a function of that coordinate — arithmetic, not a rollout, so it
is exact.

On the **full** set, at `hip_rotation_l` the ligament moment is **−26 N·m at
neutral**, reaching −153 N·m at +56°, and in the direction the plant actually
drifts it never exceeds **+4.4 N·m**. Those elements *drive* the coordinate out
of its range and never pull it back. At `knee_angle_r` they oppose flexion with
**−648 N·m at 90°**, which is not a knee.

The dominant elements at 90° of knee flexion say what is wrong:

| element | length | slack | strain | force |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| posterior cruciate | 68.1 mm | 37.5 | **0.82** | 9.1 kN |
| anterior cruciate | 59.1 mm | 33.4 | **0.77** | 7.5 kN |
| transverse ligament of knee | 75.2 mm | 26.9 | **1.79** | 3.7 kN |

A ligament whose ultimate strain is 17.1% is being asked for 77%. **A real
cruciate is near-isometric because its femoral footprint sits close to the
flexion axis and the ligament wraps; a straight line between two tip centroids
sits 22 mm off that axis and lengthens with the full lever arm.** The missing
machinery has a name: a wrap surface per joint. `PathWrap` and `WrapCylinder`
exist in OpenSim and this model already carries 52 wrap objects, but a
`Blankevoort1991Ligament` built from a two-point path has none, and fitting one
per joint from bone geometry is a piece of work that has not been done.

### The filter, and what it is not

An element that passes ligament ultimate strain **inside the declared range of a
joint it spans** is an attachment in the wrong place, not a ligament. Sweeping
each element over every coordinate on the chain between its two bodies, one at a
time with the rest at the reference pose, **66 of 117 are admissible** — 57
ligaments and 9 capsules. The threshold is not a knob tuned until a count looked
right: the same 66 pass at 10% strain and at 17.1%, then 70 at 25%, 80 at 40%,
95 at 60%. There is a real gap there.

It is a **screen, not a proof**, and it shows: at the stance pose five of the
admissible 66 are past ultimate strain anyway, all of them right-shoulder
elements, because the stance pose differs from the reference in `arm_rot_r` by
34° *and* `arm_flex_r` by 11° at once and the sweep moves one coordinate at a
time. Two coordinates together can be worse than either alone. That is stated in
the script and is what happened.

**The single-coordinate moment sweep and the rollouts do not disagree, and both
are one-sided.** Measured about one coordinate with everything else at the
reference pose, the admissible 66 make ≤ 2.2 N·m outside the declared range at
every coordinate except the metatarsophalangeal joints, and six coordinates have
no admissible element spanning them at all — a set that on that slice can do
almost nothing. Three drops later that is the better predictor of the mean
behaviour (18.35° against a bare 26.13°) than the one drop where they held.

### One thing that only became visible because something carried load

**The anatomy's registered reference pose is outside the model's own declared
range on four coordinates** — both knees by 5° (the model declares
`knee_angle ∈ [0, 2.44]` and the registration puts it at −0.09) and both
`pro_sup` by 4°. The ligaments hold those joints at the anatomy's pose and the
stops push them back toward the model's, so the two pull in opposite directions
there. Neither artifact was wrong on its own terms; they disagree, and nothing
had ever asked them to agree.

### Rendered

`ibm1-progress-archive/video/tissue_prone_drop_three_arms.mp4` — the same 2 s
prone drop three times on 429 bone surfaces of the real anatomy: bare, with all
105 ligaments, and with the joint stops plus the admissible 66. The centre panel
is a negative result rendered on purpose. The anatomy is posed from the plant, as
always; nothing there is a body moving itself.

### How to switch them on

`NativeMechanicalStream(..., tissue_ligaments='data/derived/tissue-force-elements-v1',
tissue_ligament_admissible_only=True)`, **with the joint stops still installed**.
The flag is not defaulted on: the bundle carries all 117 elements and which
subset a run wants is the caller's statement, not a silent default. Every
measurement above says to pass it, and every measurement above says not to drop
the stops.

## Cartilage, menisci and discs: a DATA gap, not a mechanics gap

The direction asks for cartilage as the thing that makes bone-on-bone contact
physical. Two measurements decide whether that is reachable.

**There is no articular cartilage in this body.** 51 cartilage entities: 34
costal, 8 laryngotracheal, 7 nasal, 2 triradiate growth plate. **Not one is a
joint surface.** `data/derived/joint-substrate-assessment-v1/` reached the same
zero independently against the *unregistered* extended atlas, and counted what
closing it would take: **1,012 cartilage layers over 506 bone contact pairs,
0.334 m² of patch area** — all of which would have to be synthesised, which is
inventing anatomy.

**And bone-on-bone contact is not a substitute.** A synovial joint's two bone
surfaces *overlap by construction* — the femoral head is inside the acetabulum —
and the measurement says so. Sweeping each scaffold joint's own declared range
and ray-parity-testing one body's bone vertices against the other's surfaces:

| joint | closest approach | configurations interpenetrating |
|---|---:|---|
| hip (l / r) | 1.2 / 0.9 mm | **21/21 and 19/21** |
| back (pelvis–torso) | 0.8 mm | 14/21 |
| ankle (l / r) | 1.0 mm | 6/7 each |
| elbow (l / r) | 0.5 mm | 5/7 each |
| metatarsophalangeal (l / r) | 0.4 mm | **7/7 each** |
| subtalar (l / r) | 2.0 mm | 1/1 each |
| knee (l / r) | 2.5 / 4.1 mm | 0/7 |
| patellofemoral, radioulnar, acromial, radiocarpal | 2.2 – 7.0 mm | 0 |

**11 of 21 joints interpenetrate somewhere in their own declared range.** An
`ElasticFoundationForce` between the two bones of such a joint would fire
permanently and invent a load the body never carries — which is exactly what the
engine's own comment warns a shared contact set would do.

Geometry is read from the model's **own** attached Body meshes, all 81 bones with
each Body's scale applied, *not* from `data/derived/segment-contact-meshes`,
which is the SimTK-admissible subset and drops both hip bones, both tibiae, the
skull, the jaw and the spine. The first run of this measurement used that subset
and reported an 82 mm hip "joint gap" — it was measuring the sacrum against the
femur.

Of the 69 menisci and discs, **59 are inside one rigid body**: 23 intervertebral
discs and 23 nuclei pulposi in `torso`, the interpubic disc in `pelvis`, the
acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular discs in `torso`. The four knee menisci
and the distal radio-ulnar discs are the ones that sit across a scaffold joint —
and the knee is the only joint in the body with intra-articular geometry to build
an articular layer from **and** bones that stay clear through its whole declared
range. That is the one reachable articular-surface job in this body.

---

## Fascia, aponeurosis and retinacula: blocked on the muscle path, not on a solver

A retinaculum is not a joint restraint. It is a strap that stops a tendon
bowstringing, and what it does mechanically is **change a muscle's path**.

Read out of the model the engine actually assembled — not the model on disk,
because `replacePathsWithFunctionBasedPaths` makes them different objects:

* **80 of 98 muscles run as `FunctionBasedPath`** — polynomials in the
  coordinates, with no via point, no wrap surface, no geometry a strap could
  touch. The 18 that keep a `GeometryPath` are the twelve `arm26` muscles and
  six trunk muscles (erector spinae and the obliques).
* The model declares **52 wrap objects** and 14 `PathWrap`s survive on those 18
  paths, so the wrap *mechanism* is present and serves only what is left.

**Not one of the 18 retinacula can constrain a muscle path in this plant.** Four
hold tendons of muscles the plant does not have at all — there is no hand or
wrist musculature, and `hand_l`/`hand_r` carry zero `PathPoint`s. The other
fourteen hold muscles the plant *does* have — `tibant`, `edl`, `ehl`, `perlong`,
`perbrev`, `tibpost`, `fdl`, `fhl`, `vasmed`, `vaslat`, `recfem` — and every one
of those is a polynomial. The blocker is not the retinaculum and not a missing
force class; it is the path substitution, and that substitution is what made the
plant affordable in the first place.

**Fascia is a different block again.** A deep fascial plane's mechanics is a
glide surface between muscle groups and a constraint on muscle bulging, and both
need a deformable continuum. `docs/SEGMENT_CONTACT_SURFACES.md` establishes there
is none anywhere in this stack: every compliant element is a 1-D spring law on a
rigid carrier. The one part of fascial mechanics a line element *could* carry is
longitudinal load transfer between two segments — the fascia lata and the three
layers of thoracolumbar fascia are the cases, and 25 of the 44 fascia entities do
span two segments. It is not modelled here because a fascia is a sheet whose
tension is distributed over its width, and a single line between two centroids
concentrates it: the same error that gave the hip capsule a 924 kN cross-section.

---

## Adipose and periosteum: acquisition, not modelling

**Periosteum: 0 entities.** Not thin, not badly bound — absent. So is
perichondrium, and so is bone marrow as geometry. Nothing can be given a force
element because there is nothing there.

**Adipose: 2 entities, both infrapatellar fat pads, 0.630 mL each — 1.26 mL of
adipose geometry in the whole body.** The only other structure that can carry
body fat is the `hypodermis` skin layer at 8.902 L, which at 950 kg/m³ is 8.46 kg.
There is **no visceral, no intermuscular and no intramuscular adipose geometry at
all**. `body_fat_fraction` is in the body-parameter schema and
`docs/BODY_PARAMETERS.md` already records that it *reaches nothing*; this is why.

**The missing fat is being carried as denser bone and muscle** (`scripts/measure_adipose_budget.py`,
2026-09-10). Known answers first: the 4,000 entity masses sum to the profile's **70.7713 kg**
exactly; `mass_allocation`'s **uniform scale 1.179437** holds on every entity with material volume
to 2.2e-16 relative, with the ledger's own 206 numerical carriers (1 mg each, no volume) excluded;
and the only entity carried at adipose density is the hypodermis -- even the two fat pads are
classed `dense_connective` at 1060 kg/m³, not 950.

| | mass | share of 70.7713 kg |
|---|---:|---:|
| fat as geometry (hypodermis, at its ledger density) | 9.975 kg | **14.1%** |
| fat as this body declares it (`profile.json` `body_fat_fraction`) | 14.862 kg | **21.0%** |
| shortfall | **4.887 kg** | a third of the declared depot |

Carrying 21% would need the hypodermis at 13.26 L against its 8.90 L. The ledger reaches the
declared total anyway, because the tissue volumes at sourced densities weigh 60.00 kg and every
entity is then multiplied by 1.179437 -- so the 4.887 kg of fat that has no geometry is
distributed over skeletal muscle (28.7 kg, 40.6%), soft tissue (11.8 kg), skeleton with marrow
(9.1 kg, 12.8%) and the rest, each 17.9% denser than its own sourced tissue density.
**That is a mass distribution no body has**, and it is upstream of everything that reads a segment
mass or an inertia: the fall proxies inscribed in inertia ellipsoids, every stance margin, and any
controller fitted to them. It is also the same gap the contact layer meets from the other side --
the subcutaneous depot that the declared 3 kPa skin cannot hold the body up with.

**Is there room for it?** Yes, and the room is where the contact layer is declared too thin.
Known answer first: the hypodermis's 5.0 mm layer over the canonical exterior skin, 1.7805 m2, is
8.90 L -- its own volume, exactly. (The skin bundle's `exterior_surface_area_m2` is 1.9198 m2
because it is in the SCAFFOLD frame, the binding map's 0.963 scale squared; using it fails this
identity by 7.9%, which is how the frame error was caught.)

| | |
|---|---:|
| declared skin layers, 6.6 mm over 1.7805 m2 | 11.75 L |
| this body's measured skin-to-bone/muscle space (median 11.0 mm, mean 14.0) | 24.86 L |
| difference | 13.11 L = 14.7 kg at fat density |
| fat with no geometry | 4.887 kg = 4.36 L |

The deficit is **33%** of that difference, so the space is ample and this is a BOUND, not an
allocation: nearest-structure depth runs to the nearest bone or muscle, and where neither is close
-- abdomen, gluteal region, breast -- the space it measures also holds fascia, vessels and glands.
What it establishes is that the hypodermis is declared thinner than this body's own surfaces
measure, with room for the fat the ledger cannot place; and since that same declared layer is the
contact model's thickness, the mass gap and the contact gap are one declaration, not two problems.

**What it would take, and why the schema cannot express it** (`--` the plan section of the same
script, computed from the ledger, nothing built). The layer's volume is area x thickness, so
thickening it raises the fat AND the total, and one thickness solves the declared fraction:
**8.10 mm** of hypodermis carries 13.702 kg, 21% of 65.249 kg unscaled. The ledger's uniform
inflation would then fall **1.1794 -> 1.0846**, 17.9% -> 8.5%, because less of the declared total
must be made up by making everything else denser. Three layers at 9.7 mm still sit under the
11.0 mm median depth.

**But a scalar layer is not anatomical at that thickness.** Against this body's own per-point
depth map, a uniform layer already exceeds the local depth over **18.8%** of the skin at its
declared 6.6 mm, and would over **41.8%** at 9.7 mm -- the sternum measures 6.6 mm and the scalp
7.4. A hypodermis that carries the declared fat has to VARY, and `shell.thickness_m` is one
number per entity. So this is a schema change (a thickness field over the skin), not a parameter
change, and it is the same field the contact layer wants for its per-patch stiffness.

**Gates, fixed now, for whenever that layer is built:**
1. the ledger still totals **70.7713 kg**, its declared target;
2. adipose / total = **0.2100 +/- 0.0005**, the profile's declared fraction;
3. the uniform scale falls to **1.0846 +/- 0.002** -- predicted here, before any build, and it
   follows from the fat volume alone, so it holds for any layer carrying 13.702 kg;
4. the layer nowhere exceeds the local measured depth: **0%** of skin points, against 18.8% today;
5. every non-skin-layer entity's volume is unchanged, and their masses move only through the
   scale;
6. the contact model reads that same per-patch thickness, so `k = E/h` and the layer map stop
   being two declarations of one quantity.

That matters mechanically and not only cosmetically.
`docs/SEGMENT_CONTACT_SURFACES.md` measured that the declared skin alone cannot
hold the body up — 761 N over ~0.02 m² of plantar skin at 1.72 MPa/m needs
~22 mm of indentation against a 6.6 mm layer — and named the missing stiffness as
the fat and muscle between skin and bone. **This is that gap, counted.**

What would have to be acquired, stated so nobody synthesises it and calls it
measured:

* **articular cartilage** — a per-joint-surface segmentation. 1,012 layers over
  506 bone contact pairs by the existing assessment's own count. No catalogued
  source in this repository ships one; BodyParts3D and Z-Anatomy both annotate
  articular *facets* as named features of the bone, not as separate surfaces.
* **periosteum** — a bone-enveloping sheet, one per bone. Derivable as an offset
  of each bone surface, which is synthesis, and must be labelled as such.
* **adipose** — subcutaneous depth per skin region, plus visceral and
  intermuscular compartments. The hypodermis carries a single thickness for the
  whole body; regional depth is what a real fat model needs and no source here
  has it.

## What still carries no force, and why — the honest list

| class | entities | blocked by |
|---|---:|---|
| bursa / synovium | 80 | a bursa is a **glide interface**, and the plant has no contact between two soft surfaces. 68 of 80 are inside one rigid body anyway. |
| meniscus / disc | 69 | 59 are inside one rigid body (23 IVDs and 23 nuclei in `torso`). The rest need an intra-articular body between two bones, which is a new mobilized body, not a force element. |
| cartilage | 51 | **no articular cartilage exists.** Data gap. |
| tendon | 44 | 36 of them are tendon **sheaths** — glide interfaces, same block as bursae. The two real tendons (calcaneal, EDL) are already inside the model's musculotendon units and adding them would double-count. |
| fascia / aponeurosis | 44 | glide surface and bulge constraint need a deformable continuum; the load-transfer part needs a sheet, not a line. |
| retinaculum | 18 | 80 of 98 muscle paths are polynomials with no geometry to constrain; the other 4 straps hold muscles this plant does not have. |
| adipose | 2 | 1.26 mL of geometry. Data gap -- see "Where adipose can come from" below. |
| periosteum | 0 | absent entirely. Data gap. |
| **ligament (inadmissible)** | 48 of 105 | a straight-line path is not a ligament's path; needs a wrap surface per joint. |
| **joint capsule (inadmissible)** | 3 of 12 | same. |

And the part that *is* now mechanics: **105 ligaments and 12 joint capsules
carry tension between two rigid bodies.** The 66 that stay within their own
failure strain across a spanned joint's declared range are never worse than the
bare plant on any of three drops, and added to the joint stops they improve the
worst excursion on all three — 5.96° mean to 5.27°. They do not replace the
stops; a first reading that said they did came from one drop and is withdrawn
above.

**"Needs a deformable continuum" is no longer true of the stack, and still true of
fascia (2026-09-18).** `ihm/assembly/soft_tissue_layer.py` is a 3-D neo-Hookean
layer per segment, from the skin to this body's measured soft-tissue depth, carried
by the segment and returning the load it transmits (`docs/SOFT_BODY.md`). It closes
none of the rows above. The adipose row stays a data gap: the layer is parameterised
by the depth map and the in-vivo layer modulus, not by any fat geometry. Fascia and
the bursae/sheaths need contact between two SOFT surfaces, and the layer only
contacts a rigid half-space. What it does give those rows is something to be built
on: a continuum whose confined limit is the shipped foundation column to 7e-12, and
whose unconfined limit is analytic neo-Hookean to 8e-10. On this body's own heel it
is 4-17x softer than the column at the same penetration, not mesh-converged at the
contact surface, and 3.6-36 s per solve.

## The 51 are a REGISTRATION failure first, and a path failure second

The section above blames the straight path and prescribes a wrap surface per
joint. Two measurements say that was the wrong order.

**Moving attachments does not fix them**
(`scripts/measure_ligament_attachment_vs_path.py`, gate: recomputed tip peaks
match the stored ones to 1.6e-14). Even the most isometric fibre inside each
ligament's own footprint rescues only **13 of 51**, and only 4 of those are taut
over more than a quarter of the joint's range, so almost all of the rescued ones
restrain nothing.

**Correcting the joint's registration does**
(`scripts/measure_ligament_registration_probe.py`). The global atlas->scaffold
similarity displaces the atlas's articular centres from the scaffold's by
**20-26 mm** at knee, ankle and hip, measured by the same closest-approach rule on
both skeletons (`scripts/measure_joint_centre_registration.py`; the same rule on
the scaffold's own bones is the control). A cruciate is 33-37 mm long, so it was
sweeping about a centre displaced by most of its own length. Translate each
failing element rigidly by its joint's displacement and re-derive its attachments
exactly as the builder does (gate: a zero translation reproduces the stored peaks
to 7.8e-15):

| | before | after one translation per joint |
|---|---:|---:|
| admissible, of the 37 crossing a measured joint | 0 | **19** |
| peak strain fell | | 33 / 37 |
| median peak strain | 0.579 | **0.170** |
| anterior cruciate | 1.216 / 1.226 | **-0.022 / -0.033** |
| posterior cruciate | 1.184 / 1.191 | 0.170 / 0.326 |
| knee collaterals and capsules | 0.44-0.78 | **-0.02 to 0.00** |

A translation is the crudest correction there is, and it is not uniformly right:
the two intra-articular hip structures get WORSE (ligament of head of femur 0.73
-> 1.15, transverse acetabular 0.26 -> 0.58), the anterior talofibulars stay at
1.1, and 14 of the 51 cross joints not measured here (wrist, radio-ulnar,
iliolumbar, MTP).

### Per-segment registration, and the control that says it is not an artefact

`scripts/fit_segment_registration.py` fits one similarity per segment and carries
each ligament END through its own bone's map. On the 51 elements v1 rejects:

| registration | admissible of 51 | median peak strain |
|---|---:|---:|
| global map (v1) | 0 | 0.521 |
| one translation per joint | 19 of 37 covered | 0.170 |
| per segment, free rotation | 30 | 0.122 |
| **per segment, twist removed** | **29** | **0.136** |
| per segment, rotation held at the global map's | 28 | 0.143 |

(gates a-d pass in every mode; gate c reproduces the stored v1 strains to 7.8e-15.)

The free fit's rotations are suspect on the long bones -- femur 19.8 deg relative
to the global map of which 19.8 is twist about its own axis, radius 32-36 deg,
all spin -- because point-to-point ICP cannot determine an elongated bone's spin,
and a spin moves a ligament's attachment round the bone. **The controls say the
rescue does not ride on it**: removing the twist costs one element and holding
the rotation fixed entirely costs two. What rescues these ligaments is each bone's
per-segment position and scale, i.e. putting the joints where the scaffold's are.

`tissue-force-elements-v2` is built with
`--registration per-segment --segment-registration .../anatomy-segment-registration-rot-no-twist/registration.json`
(gate: `--registration global` reproduces v1's `ligaments.json` exactly):

| | v1 | v2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| tensile elements admissible, of 117 | 66 | **95** |
| gained / lost | | 29 / **0** |
| cruciates | 0 / 4 | **4 / 4**, peak 0.143 |
| collaterals | | **16 / 16**, peak 0.123 |

Still failing in v2: the anterior talofibulars, the ligament of the head of the
femur, the transverse ligament of the knee, the iliolumbars, and wrist and midfoot
elements that cross joints this scaffold does not have. Those are the ones a wrap
surface or a new joint has to answer, and they are now a short list.

**v2 is not yet the plant's.** v1 was judged on three drops against the joint
stops; v2 has to be judged the same way before it replaces it.

#### Direction, not magnitude

`scripts/measure_ligament_moments.py --tissue ...` gives each coordinate's passive
ligament moment outside its declared range. Its summary line is a MAGNITUDE, and
v1's pathology was a DIRECTION -- ligaments driving joints out of range instead of
pulling them back. So every out-of-range sample is classed restoring or driving.

On the **full** element set, v2 fixes the knee (v1 drove it at up to 101 N.m; v2
restores on all 36 samples) and appears to introduce a hip-flexion drive, 0 / 18
samples on the left and up to 37 N.m on the right.
`scripts/measure_hip_flexion_drive.py` (gate: per-element sums reproduce the moment
check to 4.3e-4 N.m) puts that drive on **one element per side, the ligament of the
head of the femur**, carrying 2.4-7.1 kN in v2 and 12.9-14.7 kN in v1. It is
inadmissible in both builds: an intra-articular ligament ~30 mm long, slack most of
the time in a real hip, crossing a hip centre still 11-15 mm misregistered. No
straight line from registered ends represents it.

The plant only ever receives the **admissible** set, so that is the comparison
that decides (66 elements in v1, 95 in v2):

| coordinate | v1 restoring / driving (worst drive), samples past the stop | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| knee | 5 / 11 (0.3 N.m), 1 | **18 / 0, 13-14** |
| ankle | 0 / 0 -- no restraint | 12 / 12 (0.1 N.m), **12** |
| forearm pronation | 11-13 / 0, 2-4 | 20 / 2, **11** |
| hip rotation | 26 / 0, 13 | 26 / 0, 13 |
| hip flexion | ~0 | ~0 (the femoral-head drive is excluded) |
| hip adduction | 5-6 / 16-18 (1.6 N.m) | 4-5 / 18-21 (**2.6 N.m**) |
| **toe MTP** | 30 / 0, **15** | 15-16 / 13-15, **0-1** |
| elbow flexion R | 11 / 0, 2 | 0 / 0 |
| **total** | 169 / 70 / 77 | **192 / 107 / 109** |

Net: v2's admissible set restrains the knee harder than the joint stop, adds an
ankle restraint where v1 had none, and improves pronation. It LOSES the toe
restraint -- consistent with the 17 deg forefoot swing the toe registration took
(docs/SEGMENT_CONTACT_SURFACES.md) -- and the right elbow's, and its largest drive
(hip adduction) grows from 1.6 to 2.6 N.m, still small against a 30 N.m/rad stop.
That is arithmetic at a held pose; the drops are the dynamic test.

#### The drops: v2 halves the worst excursion when added to the stops

`scripts/measure_tissue_mechanics.py --tissue data/derived/tissue-force-elements-v2`,
the same three drops that judged v1. Gate: the arms that carry no tissue at all
reproduce v1's recorded excursions on every drop to 0.01 deg (bare 17.43 / 30.69 /
30.27, stops 5.30 / 6.62 / 5.96).

Worst excursion past the declared ranges, deg:

| arm | prone | prone_high | prone_rolled | mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| bare | 17.43 | 30.69 | 30.27 | 26.13 |
| stops | 5.30 | 6.62 | 5.96 | 5.96 |
| v1 admissible | 6.08 | 30.47 | 18.50 | 18.35 |
| **v2 admissible** | **5.15** | **17.86** | **7.65** | **10.22** |
| v1 stops + admissible | 4.07 | 6.39 | 5.35 | 5.27 |
| **v2 stops + admissible** | **2.12** | **2.91** | **3.36** | **2.80** |
| v2 full set | 31.41 | 33.30 | 31.90 | 32.20 |

(v1's prone stops + admissible is not recorded separately; 4.07 is the documented
5.27 mean less the two recorded drops.)

* **Added to the stops, v2's admissible ligaments halve the worst excursion on
  every drop**, 5.96 -> 2.80 deg mean, where v1's took it 5.96 -> 5.27.
* **Alone, v2 does not replace the stops** -- 17.86 against 6.62 on the high drop
  -- though it roughly halves what v1 did alone (18.35 -> 10.22 mean).
* **The full set is worse than no tissue on every drop** (32.20 against 26.13),
  because it carries the inadmissible elements, including the femoral-head ligament
  that drives hip flexion. Only the admissible set is ever a candidate for the plant.

So v2's admissible set is the recommended tissue set for the participant plant,
added to the joint stops, not in place of them. The measurement scripts still
default to v1 so every result already recorded reproduces; switching the plant's
default is a separate, deliberate step.

#### ...and in the crawl it is neutral

`scripts/crawl.py --tissue DIR` loads a set's admissible elements into the plant alongside
the stops. Search B's best crawl parameters replayed for 16 s, three ways (gate: the
stops-only replay reproduces the recorded crawl, 0.9200 m and 0.2003 rad at the right
ankle -- PASS):

| arm | reaches 16 s | travel | worst excursion | peak fibre velocity (of 10) | wall clock |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| stops | yes | 0.9200 m | 0.2003 rad, ankle_angle_r | 9.69 | 707 s |
| stops + v1 admissible | **no -- 0.01 s** | 0 | -- | 5.20 | 8 s |
| stops + v2 admissible | yes | 0.9146 m | 0.1987 rad, ankle_angle_r | **9.99** | 863 s |

* **v1 cannot start the crawl.** A joint-speed guard stopped it on the first advance, with
  arm_rot_r past 25 rad/s.
* **v2 does no harm and no good here.** Travel and worst excursion are within 1% of the
  stops alone. The drop tests' halving was unactuated falls; in actuated crawling the stops
  already hold the worst excursion to 0.2 rad, at an ankle v2 barely restrains.
* **Its costs:** 22% more wall clock, and peak fibre velocity at 9.99 of the muscle model's
  10 -- at the edge of the force-velocity domain, where the stops-only crawl had 3% to spare.

One trajectory per arm: v2 is safe to carry in locomotion; its benefit is not shown there.

## What would move this next, in order

1. **Per-segment registration of the atlas onto the scaffold**, before any wrap
   surface. One translation per joint already rescues 19 of 37 and brings both
   cruciates inside their ultimate strain; a proper per-segment map is the same
   fix the skin needs (`docs/SEGMENT_CONTACT_SURFACES.md`). Only what survives
   THAT should be judged against the item below.
2. **A wrap surface per scaffold joint**, fitted from the bone geometry, so a
   ligament path bends where a real one does. This is the single change that
   would turn the 51 inadmissible elements from wrong into useful, and those 51
   are the cruciates, the collaterals and the ankle ligaments — precisely the
   ones that carry a real joint's restraint. The 66 that survive the filter
   survive it largely because they barely change length with the joint, which is
   the same thing as saying they have little to restrain.
3. **Articular cartilage geometry.** Acquisition, not modelling. Until it exists
   there is no articular surface to make physical, and the knee is the only joint
   with intra-articular geometry to start from.
4. **Reversing the path substitution for the ankle and knee muscles**, at a
   measured wall-clock cost, so the six ankle retinacula have something to hold.
4. **Regional subcutaneous depth**, which is simultaneously the adipose gap and
   the reason the declared skin cannot hold the body up.


## Where adipose can come from (2026-09-10)

This body carries two adipose entities, 1.26 mL, and the programme requires contact to be
mediated by fat, muscle and skin rather than bone. Two routes were checked:

* **TotalSegmentator `tissue_types` / `tissue_4_types`** (subcutaneous_fat, torso_fat,
  skeletal_muscle, intermuscular_fat): **licensed**, listed under "Available with a license"
  in the tool's README. A licence is free for non-commercial use but is obtained through a web
  registration form (`backend.totalsegmentator.com/license-academic/`) that only the programme
  owner can submit; the key is then set with `totalseg_set_license -l <key>`. Not obtained.
* **CT attenuation, no model and no licence.** Fat is defined physically on CT: -190 to -30 HU
  is the standard adipose window, and it is the threshold TotalSegmentator's own
  `tissue_4_types` post-processing uses. Applied inside the Apache-2.0 `body` mask, it gives an
  adipose segmentation for the CT subjects already on disk (s0790, s1159, s0970), split into
  subcutaneous and deep by distance from the skin. Tested on the three CT subjects that pass
  every extraction gate:

    subject   body L  fat L  fat % breast mL breast fat % glandular %     T6    T12  T12-120  T12-250   (subcutaneous depth, 95th pct, mm)
    s0790       37.9  12.74   33.6      1161         82.6        13.8   36.5   18.1     51.0     37.3
    s1159       34.3   7.35   21.4       956         67.0        29.7   16.8   10.6     34.0     28.1
    s0970       35.3  10.58   30.0      1437         87.8        11.5   43.5   14.8     31.7      nan

  Two checks, neither a known answer in the strict sense, both passed. The breast is fat plus
  glandular tissue, and glandular tissue (~30-50 HU) falls OUTSIDE the window, so the share of
  breast voxels in the window is the breast's fat fraction; it lands in or just above the range a
  rough prior expects for these ages, with the glandular remainder in the -30..100 HU band. And
  the skin-connected fat is deepest over the lower abdomen and hips, thinner over the upper
  abdomen -- the female, lower-body distribution. Limitation: "subcutaneous" is fat connected to
  the outer 3 mm of the body, so where the abdominal wall thins some deep fat can join it; the
  lower-abdominal depths may include deep fat. This gives a fat layer for three female subjects,
  not for this body; carrying one onto this body's skin is the skin-envelope problem.


## Articular cartilage: the knee, and its gates fixed before any data is seen (2026-09-10)

This body has no articular cartilage. OAIZIB-CM (cc-by-nc-4.0; 507 OAI knee MRIs; labels femur,
femoral cartilage, tibia, medial and lateral tibial cartilage) supplies it for the knee. Only the
label archives are taken: the femur and tibia carry the registration, the cartilage is the
geometry. The registration follows the pelvic one -- a knee MRI crops both bones, so one-way ICP
pulls the MRI's partial bone surfaces onto this body's COMPLETE femur and tibia, never the reverse.

Gates, committed before a single subject is registered:
* **known answer:** this body's own femur and tibia, truncated the way a knee MRI field of view
  crops them, moved by a known similarity, are recovered within 2 mm, 2 deg and 1%.
* **which knee:** OAI images one knee per scan. Each subject is fitted to BOTH of this body's
  knees; the lower one-way residual must win by at least 20%, or the side is undetermined and
  the subject is excluded.
* **placement:** at least 95% of the mapped femoral cartilage lies within 3 mm of this body's
  femoral surface and at most 1% inside the femur; the same for tibial cartilage and the tibia.
* **joint space:** mapped femoral and tibial cartilage overlap by at most 1% of the smaller
  volume at this body's reference pose.
Reported, not judged: cartilage thickness (OAI knees are older and often osteoarthritic, so
thin or eroded cartilage is expected and is the cohort's, not the registration's).

### Pilot: 0 of 6 pass, and the reason is this body's knee, not the fit (07e3415)

`scripts/register_knee_cartilage.py`, six KL-0 right knees (three coded male, three female, by the
anatomy-established coding on the source card). **Known answer: PASS** -- this body's right femur
and tibia cut to a 112 x 140 x 140 mm field of view (25% and 30% of their surface kept) and moved
by the brief's 9 deg similarity and a harder 110 deg one are recovered to <= 0.026 mm, 0.12 deg,
0.021%.

| subject | residual R / L | which knee | femoral cart. within 3 mm / inside | tibial within 3 mm / inside | overlap |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| oaizib_001 | 1.27 / 2.58 mm | R, PASS | 81.1% / 15.3% | 85.2% / 24.9% | 16.7% |
| oaizib_002 | 1.39 / 2.84 | R, PASS | 89.6% / 29.0% | 88.5% / 27.1% | 16.2% |
| oaizib_003 | 1.07 / 2.95 | R, PASS | 79.3% / 21.5% | 85.0% / 28.9% | 15.9% |
| oaizib_004 | 1.22 / 2.61 | R, PASS | 78.8% / 13.3% | 93.6% / 26.8% | 19.3% |
| oaizib_005 | 1.33 / 2.57 | R, PASS | 78.6% / 21.2% | 88.2% / 15.5% | 12.3% |
| oaizib_006 | 1.35 / 2.60 | R, PASS | 60.7% / 16.1% | 81.4% / 32.4% | 17.6% |

Which-knee passes on all six (every OAI knee is a right knee, so that is a real check), the medial
tibial cartilage lands nearer the midline on all six, and mean thickness is 1.3-2.4 mm. Placement
and joint space fail on all six.

**Why.** This body's femur and tibia are drawn almost touching: the closest vertices are 0.64 mm
apart on the right and 1.21 mm on the left (checked independently of the pilot; 2 of 857 right
tibia vertices lie within 1 mm of the femur, 19 within 3 mm), where the scans' own bones stay
3.3 mm apart. Two ~2 mm cartilage layers cannot fit in that gap, so overlap and cartilage inside
bone are forced whatever the fit. The fit itself sits where it should: the mapped scan bone
coincides with this body's bone (50-53% of its samples inside, as for two coincident surfaces),
residual 1.1-1.4 mm. That the body's femur matches the scans' BONE surface rather than their
cartilage surface says the cartilage is not already inside these bone meshes; the bones are simply
drawn in contact.

**Tested, 2026-09-10: it is the SOURCE, not the pose, and the scaffold's own knee is open.** The
same nearest-surface measure, applied to the scaffold's bone meshes carried into ground by the
reference run's body transforms:

| knee, bone to bone | right | left |
|---|---:|---:|
| canonical anatomy (BodyParts3D) | **0.64 mm** | 1.21 mm |
| scaffold (OpenSim, at its reference pose) | **3.02 mm** | 4.57 mm |
| the OAI subjects' own bones | 3.3 mm | -- |

Femur to patella on the scaffold is 3.49 mm, and no tibia vertex lies within 3 mm of the femur on
either side. So a knee in this programme does have room for cartilage -- in the plant. The atlas
knee does not, at a pose the plant does not use, which makes the closed joint a property of the
canonical anatomy rather than of the pose or of the engine. **That reopens the knee line**: the
cartilage the pilot could not place belongs on the scaffold's femur and tibia, which have the 3 mm
it needs, or the atlas knee has to be corrected before its bones can carry any.
(Instrument check: a cloud against itself reads 0.000 mm, and against a copy translated 10 mm no
point exceeds 10.000 mm -- less where the surface curves toward the shift, because this is a
nearest-surface distance and not a displacement.)

### Knee cartilage, second attempt: onto the bones that have room. Gates fixed 2026-09-10

The pilot registered onto the CANONICAL femur and tibia, which are 0.64 mm apart, so placement and
joint space could not pass whatever the fit did. The scaffold's are 3.02 mm apart, which is what
the subjects' own bones keep, and the scaffold's bones are also what the plant moves -- cartilage
carried there is cartilage the engine can use as contact geometry. So the target changes and
nothing else does.

* **The instrument.** `scripts/register_knee_cartilage.py`'s one-way trimmed ICP, unchanged, with
  the SCAFFOLD's femur and tibia meshes as the target in place of the canonical ones.
* **Gate 1, known answer.** The scaffold's own femur and tibia, truncated as a knee MRI's field of
  view crops them, moved by a known similarity, recovered within **2 mm, 2 deg, 1%** -- the gate
  the pilot passed at 0.026 mm on the canonical bones, now to be passed on these.
* **Gate 2, which knee.** Unchanged: each subject is fitted to both knees and the lower one-way
  residual must win by at least 20%, or the subject is excluded. Every OAI knee is a right knee,
  so this remains a real check.
* **Gate 3, placement -- and the criterion is validated on the SOURCE before it judges anything.**
  The pilot's "95% of the cartilage surface within 3 mm of the bone" was void as a measurement: on
  the subjects' own scans, before any registration, it reads 85-97%. The replacement is the same
  test on the cartilage's BONE-FACING surface only (the half whose outward normal points at the
  bone), and it is first run in each subject's own frame, where the answer is known: **if it does
  not reach 95% there, the criterion is void and is reported as void rather than used.** Only if
  it passes on the source is it applied to the mapped cartilage against the scaffold's bone.
* **Gate 4, joint space.** Unchanged: mapped femoral and tibial cartilage overlap by at most 1% of
  the smaller volume, at the plant's reference pose.
* **Reported, not judged:** cartilage thickness, and the cartilage-inside-bone fraction by volume.

**Predicted before it runs:** gate 4 passes on most knees, because 3.02 mm of room is what two
~1.5 mm layers need, and the cartilage-inside-bone fraction falls from 4.5-20% to near zero. If
placement still fails with 3 mm of room and a criterion that passes on the source, then the fit is
what is wrong, not the geometry -- and that would be the first evidence pointing there.

### Result: the room is real, and this body's RIGHT FEMUR is not its left one mirrored (73dc626)

Gate 2 passes 6 of 6 (right wins by 48-62%). Gate 4 falls roughly tenfold -- overlap 12-19% under
the canonical target becomes **0.00-2.13%** -- so the 3 mm of joint space is real and two knees now
pass outright; four sit at 1.17-2.13% against a 1% bar. Gate 1 was re-earned on the scaffold's bones
after failing three times, each fix to the SEARCH and never to a threshold: 24 principal-axis starts
put the tibia 129 deg out (the scaffold's `tibia_r` body carries the **fibula**, which the OAIZIB
tibia label does not, so the two clouds' principal frames genuinely disagree), a one-way residual has
a degenerate minimum at 0.00 mm reachable by shrinking the source onto a point, and a cheap screen is
only a proxy for the full fit. It now searches 2,072 fixed rotations, bounds scale to 0.5-2.0, and
finishes the best three. A frame bug came out with it: left-right is **z** in the scaffold's ground
frame and **x** in the canonical one, and fixing it took the medial-cartilage check from 4 of 6 to
6 of 6.

**Gate 3 fails, and my prediction that this would indict the fit is refuted by its own ceiling.**
Each subject's OWN bone surface, carried through the same map, lands only 79-91% within 3 mm of the
scaffold bone and **42-53% inside** it. The cartilage scores no worse than the bone it is glued to,
and often better. Roughly half inside is what two coincident surfaces look like.

**Why: the target is 265 faces with 18.5 mm median edges, and it is the odd one out of the whole
body.** `scripts/audit_scaffold_mirror_symmetry.py` mirrors every paired mesh the model references
against its opposite: **36 of 37 agree to 0.000 mm on every vertex** -- both tibiae, both fibulae,
both patellae, both feet, the talus, humerus, radius, ulna and all twenty hand bones. **One does
not.** `l_femur.vtp` is 908 faces, `r_femur.vtp` is 265, and mirrored they differ by a median of
**9.33 mm** and up to **56.39 mm**. The right femur is not this body's left femur reflected; it is a
different, coarser surface standing in for one bone. A 3 mm placement criterion sits far below an
18.5 mm facet, so on the right knee gate 3 measures the target's resolution rather than the
registration.

**Nothing already in this repository could have caught it.** The per-segment registration's own
residuals read femur_l **3.88 mm** and femur_r **3.94** -- an ICP against the atlas fits each side
about as well whatever surface is there, so a wrong right femur costs it nothing, and the exact
mirrors give the control: tibia_l 5.28 against tibia_r 5.29. Mirror agreement is an invariant this
body satisfies 36 times out of 37 and no gate here tested until now.

That asymmetry reaches past this gate. The knee gaps recorded above -- 3.02 mm right against 4.57 mm
left -- are measured on these same meshes, so part of that difference is the right femur's own
coarseness rather than the body's anatomy. Any bilateral femur measurement in this repository
inherits it.

**Next, pre-registered before it is run:** re-target the right knee onto **the left femur mirrored**,
which is what every other bone in this model already is, and re-run gates 1-4 unchanged. Reported
beside them: the same run on the present right femur, so the two targets can be read against each
other. **RESULT (751db56): the ceiling rises on every subject and gate 4 goes further than
predicted.** The mirror is verified at load rather than assumed -- l_tibia to r_tibia and l_patella
to r_patella reflect to 0.000 mm about mesh axis 2, the femurs are not a pair at all (456 vertices
against 132), and the target refuses to build if that ever stops holding. The right knee gap goes
**2.02 -> 3.47 mm**, matching the left's 3.32. Gate 1 passes on the new target (<= 0.029 mm,
0.153 deg, 0.057%); gate 2 passes 6 of 6 with margins 48-62% -> 22-76%. The femur ceiling rises on
**every** subject, mean **82.2% -> 88.9%** within 3 mm, and femoral placement follows,
88.3% -> 91.1%. **Gate 4: 2 of 6 becomes 4 of 5 sound fits**, beyond the prediction, because the
mirrored femur also opens the gap the overlap is measured in; only oaizib_003 remains over, at 1.97%.

**Gate 3's "inside" half cannot be met by any registration, and that is my error.** The subject's
OWN bone, carried by the same map, is **42-53% inside** the target: a surface registered onto
another sits about half inside it at any nonzero residual. The source-frame validation I required
cannot catch this -- it scores the criterion against a perfect fit onto the SAME bone, where the
labels are exclusive and the answer is 0%, which is a different situation from a real fit onto a
different bone. The "within 3 mm" half is now met on several bones; the "inside" half was never
measurable as written.

**One fit was quietly degenerate, and only running two targets found it.** oaizib_006's tibia
collapsed to scale **0.529** against a target the other five fitted at 0.958-1.090, dropping its
cartilage from 4.6 mL to 0.6 and handing it a spurious 0.00% joint-space pass. The 0.5-2.0 scale
bound admitted it. A knee's two bones belong to one person, so their scales are now compared and a
disagreement over 20% marks the subject suspect and fails it -- a correctness condition, adopted
without touching the bound it slipped through.

#### Gate 3 replaced, and the moving knee tested. Fixed 2026-09-10, before either runs

* **Gate 3', paired against the ceiling.** The criterion is no longer an absolute share but a
  comparison with the same map's own performance on the bone: the cartilage's "within 3 mm" must be
  **no more than 5 points below the ceiling's**, and its "inside" **no more than 5 points above**.
  A bad fit cannot pass it, because the ceiling moves with the fit; and it is measurable, which the
  absolute form was not.
* **Gate 3'', signed.** Cartilage sits ON bone, so the median signed offset of the mapped cartilage
  from the bone surface, along the bone's outward normal, must be **positive**. Half-inside by
  residual is symmetric noise; a negative median is cartilage buried in bone.
* **Gate 4', the moving knee.** Overlap is currently measured at the reference pose alone, and
  oaizib_003 is already over at rest. Measure it at knee flexion **0, 30, 60 and 90 degrees**,
  driven by the plant's own joint, and report the curve. The pass is at every angle, not the mean.
* **Reported:** the flexion at which each subject first exceeds 1%, which is the number a crawl
  cares about.

**Predicted:** gate 3' passes on the femur for most subjects, since cartilage already tracks its
bone within a point or two; gate 3'' passes, because a cartilage label sits outside its bone in the
source; and **gate 4' fails at flexion for most knees**, since the tibiofemoral gap narrows as the
knee bends and four of five are within 0.5% of the bar at rest. If gate 4' fails, cartilage from
this source cannot be carried as contact geometry through a crawl, and that is the finding rather
than a defect.

#### Result: gate 4' passes at every angle for 4 of 5, and gate 3'' has no headroom on the tibia

Six KL-0 knees onto the mirrored-left femur, gates 1 and 2 unchanged and passing (known answer
<= 0.029 mm, 0.153 deg, 0.057%; which knee 6 of 6, margins 22-76%). oaizib_006 is flagged SUSPECT
FIT and is excluded from every count below.

| subject | 3' paired femur/tibia | 3'' signed femur/tibia | overlap 0/30/60/90 deg | 4' |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| oaizib_001 | PASS / PASS | +0.69 / **-0.21** mm | 0.02 / 0.00 / 0.06 / 0.40% | PASS |
| oaizib_002 | PASS / PASS | **-0.29** / +0.14 mm | 0.38 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00% | PASS |

**Gate 4' passes at every angle for 4 of 5.** The prediction was that it would fail at flexion
because the tibiofemoral gap narrows as the knee bends. It does not narrow: driven by the plant's
own `walker_knee_r`, the femur-tibia surface gap goes 3.47 mm at 0 deg to 6.15 at 30 and 60 and
4.72 at 90, so overlap *falls* as soon as the knee leaves full extension. The single failure,
oaizib_003, is over the bar **only at 0 deg** (1.97%) and clears at every flexed angle. That
inverts the worry: for these knees the reference pose is the worst case, not the crawl.

The knee is re-evaluated from the model the engine loads, in `ihm/spatial/opensim.py`'s convention,
not by the native solver. Its known answer: at `knee_angle_r` = 0 it reproduces the plant's own
recorded tibia pose to **1.4e-14 mm and 0 deg**. It stays articulated across the sweep, which is
what says the composition is right.

**Gate 3'' cannot be read on the tibia.** Measured after the fact with the same signed instrument,
the CEILING surface -- the scan's own bone carried by the same map -- has a negative signed median
on the tibia in all six subjects (-0.09 to -0.30 mm, median **-0.18**). The registered bone surface
itself sits inside the plant's tibia, so cartilage correctly placed on that bone cannot show a
positive median: the gate has no headroom there and its three tibia FAILs (001, 003, 004) say
nothing about the cartilage. On the femur the ceiling's median is **+0.12 mm** (min -0.12, max
+0.45). The FAILs stand on the record as FAILs; this is a diagnostic of whether they can be
interpreted, computed from the transforms in the manifest without refitting.

#### Gate 3'' is RETIRED as unmeasurable, and the femur's margin goes with it

Ordered before the numbers were read, with the decision rule fixed in advance: bootstrap the signed
median's OWN sampling uncertainty over the surface samples, per subject and per bone. Under 0.05 mm
and a paired form of 3'' would be measurable; comparable to the separations in play and 3'' is
retired rather than replaced.

**The floor is 0.103 mm** (median 95% interval half-width across all 24 subject-bone cells; per-cell
half-widths 0.041-0.160). The separations it would have to resolve are the ceiling's own medians,
+0.12 mm on the femur and -0.18 on the tibia. They are the same size. Two independent estimates
agree -- resampling the recorded draw and 30 fresh area-weighted draws give the same spread per cell
(0.048 against 0.056, 0.029 against 0.028) -- so this is the quantity's own resolution, not an
artefact of the bootstrap.

So gate 3'' is retired as unmeasurable, and the femur's "+0.12 mm, readable with that margin in
mind" falls with it: the femur verdicts are uninterpretable in exactly the way the tibia's are. This
is the same death as gate A in de88ef4 -- a bar quoted finer than the floor beneath it. A signed
median resolved to about 0.1 mm cannot adjudicate a placement whose fit residual is ~1.5 mm.

**The recorded tally of 0 of 6 passing every gate is therefore partly an artefact of a gate with no
headroom, and that caveat travels wherever the tally is quoted.** Setting 3'' aside, 3 of the 5
sound fits pass gates 1, 2, 3' and 4' -- a count taken after a gate was retired, not a new result.

Not adopted, and not to be cited as motivation for any replacement: the cartilage's signed median
sits above the ceiling's in 9 of 12 bones. That is a count taken after the fact, in the direction
its designer hoped for, with no floor beneath it -- the shape of half the rows in the ledger. The
script now records `median_signed_floor_mm` beside every signed median, so no successor to 3'' can
be quoted without its own resolution beside it.

**As lead, that pre-registration is refused for now, and a measurement is ordered in front of it.**
The quantities a paired 3'' would separate are the ceiling's **+0.12 mm** on the femur and
**-0.18 mm** on the tibia, against a fit residual of about **1.5 mm**. Nothing in this line has
established that a signed median offset is *resolvable* at a tenth of its own residual. Gate A died
of exactly this in `de88ef4` -- a 0.5 mm bar sitting on a 0.288 mm measurement noise plus 0.416 mm
of smoothing, so the bar was inside the floor and the gate could never have been passed or failed on
its merits. Writing a paired 3'' now would repeat that with a bar ten times finer.

**Ordered first, and it is a measurement with no gate attached:** the noise floor of the signed
median offset itself. Bootstrap it over the surface samples for each bone and subject to get its
sampling uncertainty, and report that uncertainty beside every signed median already recorded.
Fixed before the number is read:

* **If the floor is well below the separations in play** -- say under 0.05 mm against a +0.12 /
  -0.18 mm spread -- then a paired 3'' is measurable and gets pre-registered properly, in its own
  entry, labelled **post-hoc** (it is being designed after 3'' failed and after the 9-of-12 pattern
  was seen), applied to **every** subject, and **not** permitted to overturn the existing 3''
  verdicts, which stand as recorded.
* **If the floor is comparable to those separations**, gate 3'' is **retired as unmeasurable**
  rather than replaced. That is the honest outcome and it costs the line a gate: the femur's
  +0.12 mm "readable with that margin in mind" would also fall, and the femur 3'' verdicts already
  recorded become uninterpretable in the same way the tibia's are.

The 9-of-12 pattern is **not** evidence for the paired form and must not be cited as its
motivation. It is a count taken after the fact, in the direction the designer hoped for, with no
floor beneath it -- which is the shape of half the rows in `docs/LOG.md`'s ledger.

**The one thing the ceiling diagnostic does settle**, independently of any floor: the tibia's
ceiling median is negative in **all six** subjects, so cartilage placed correctly on that surface
**cannot** show a positive median. The three tibia FAILs say nothing about cartilage placement, and
the "0 of 6 subjects pass every gate" headline is partly an artefact of a gate with no headroom. It
stays recorded as 0 of 6, with that caveat attached wherever it is quoted.

**Gate 3' paired passes 4 of 5 on the femur and 5 of 5 on the tibia.** The one failure, oaizib_005,
is 8.2 points below its femur ceiling. A pattern was nearly written up here from oaizib_005 and
oaizib_006 alone -- that the femur fails systematically because it is the one non-mirrored bone --
and the count refutes it: 4 of 5 pass.

Caveats that travel with these numbers: six knees, all KL 0; the flexion sweep moves the tibia
through the joint's own kinematics but no soft tissue resists it, and cartilage is carried rigidly,
so nothing here models contact; the known answer remains a self-fit and bounds the search, not the
anatomy. Meshes and manifest: `data/derived/knee-cartilage-registered-v3-mirrored-femur/`, with the
ceiling diagnostic beside them in `ceiling_signed_diagnostic.txt`.

**Predicted (the earlier round):** the ceiling rises toward the left knee's and gate 3's placement improves
markedly, while gate 4's overlap moves little, because overlap is set by the joint's gap and not by
the facet size. **Not decided here:** whether the PLANT should carry the mirrored femur. That
changes contact geometry and every stance result measured on it, and it is the owner's call, not a
registration detail.

**The placement gate fails its own known answer.** In each scan's own frame, before any
registration, only 85-97% of the femoral cartilage surface lies within 3 mm of its own femur --
cartilage is up to ~3 mm thick and the gate samples its whole surface. A gate the ground truth
fails cannot separate a good registration from a bad one, so its verdicts here carry no
information about the fit. It is recorded as void as a measurement, not loosened; a replacement
(for instance on the cartilage's bone-facing surface only, checked first on the scans' own frames)
would be a new pre-registration, made before any subject is scored on it.

Two metric corrections the pilot made to itself, both changing no verdict: the first overlap
measure read 2.2% on the scans' own mutually exclusive labels (answer: 0) and was replaced by an
exact label lookup (0.00%); cartilage inside bone measured by VOLUME rather than surface is
4.5-20%, recorded as evidence only. Meshes and manifest: `data/derived/knee-cartilage-registered-v1/`.
**Not to be used as contact geometry** until the joint space is resolved -- in this body's canonical
bones, or by carrying the cartilage with the plant's own femur and tibia, which set the running
joint's gap.
